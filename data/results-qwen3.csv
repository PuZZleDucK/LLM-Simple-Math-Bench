2. Add the results:
   - $ 5 + 10 = 15 $

However, this approach only accounts for the sum of 5 and 10, not the full multiplication. The correct way is to perform the multiplication directly:

$$
5 \times 12 = 5 \times (10 + 2) = 5 \times 10 + 5 \times 2 = 50 + 10 = 60

250-58-17-26-39 #1: To compute the expression:

$$
250 - 58 - 17 - 26 - 39
$$

We can approach this by simplifying the subtraction step by step:

---

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Start with 250**  
   $$
   250 - 58 = 192
   $$

2. **Subtract 17**  
   $$
   192 - 17 = 175
   $$

3. **Subtract 26**  
   $$
   175 - 26 = 149
   $$

4. **Subtract 39**  
   $$
   149 - 39 = 110
   $$

---

### Alternative Method (Grouping):

We can also group the subtrahends:

$$
58 + 17 + 26 + 39 = 140
$$

So:

$$
250 - 140 = 110
$$

We can approach the problem step by step:

---

### Step 1: Add the first two numbers

$$
638 + 837
$$

Break it down:

- Units: $8 + 7 = 15$ → Write 5, carry 1
- Tens: $3 + 3 = 6 + 1 = 7$
- Hundreds: $6 + 8 = 14$

So, the result is:

$$
1475
$$

---

### Step 2: Add the third number to the result

$$
1475 + 921
$$

Break it down:

- Units: $5 + 1 = 6$
- Tens: $7 + 2 = 9$
- Hundreds: $4 + 9 = 13$ → Write 3, carry 1
- Thousands: $1 + 0 + 1 = 2$

1000-104-305-88-17-56 #1: To compute the expression:

$$
1000 - 104 - 305 - 88 - 17 - 56
$$

we can approach this in two ways: step-by-step subtraction or by first summing all the numbers being subtracted and then subtracting that total from 1000.

---

### **Method 1: Step-by-Step Subtraction**

Start with 1000:

1. $ 1000 - 104 = 896 $
2. $ 896 - 305 = 591 $
3. $ 591 - 88 = 503 $
4. $ 503 - 17 = 486 $
5. $ 486 - 56 = 430 $

So, the result is **430**.

---

### **Method 2: Sum of Subtrahends**

Add all the numbers being subtracted:

$$
104 + 305 + 88 + 17 + 56
$$

Break it down:

- $ 104 + 305 = 409 $
- $ 409 + 88 = 497 $
- $ 497 + 17 = 514 $
- $ 514 + 56 = 570 $

Now subtract this total from 1000:

$$
1000 - 570 = 430
$$

---

### **Final Answer**

$$
\boxed{430}

$$

we can simplify the process by first summing all the numbers being subtracted:

$$
638 + 837 + 921 + 145 + 302
$$

Let's add them step by step:

- $638 + 837 = 1475$
- $1475 + 921 = 2396$
- $2396 + 145 = 2541$
- $2541 + 302 = 2843$

$$

we can approach this by either performing the subtractions step-by-step or by first summing all the numbers being subtracted and then subtracting that total from 20000.

---

### Step 1: Sum all the numbers being subtracted

$$
1205 + 9876 + 4321 + 555 + 678
$$

- $11081 + 4321 = 15402$
- $15402 + 555 = 15957$
- $15957 + 678 = 16635$

So the total of all the numbers being subtracted is **16635**.

---

### Step 2: Subtract this total from 20000

$$
20000 - 16635 = 3365
$$

- $11081 + 4321 = 15402$
- $15402 + 555 = 15957$
- $15957 + 678 = 16635$

So the total of all the numbers being subtracted is **16635**.

---

### Step 2: Subtract this total from 20000

$$
20000 - 16635 = 3365
$$

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{3365}

---

### Step 1: Prime Factorization

We break each number into its prime factors:

- $12 = 2^2 \times 3$
- $15 = 3 \times 5$
- $7 = 7$
- $3 = 3$
- $2 = 2$
- $5 = 5$

Now, combine all the factors:

$$
(2^2 \times 3) \times (3 \times 5) \times 7 \times 3 \times 2 \times 5
$$

Grouping like terms:

- $2^2 \times 2 = 2^3$
- $3 \times 3 \times 3 = 3^3$
- $5 \times 5 = 5^2$
- $7 = 7$

So the full prime factorization is:

$$
2^3 \times 3^3 \times 5^2 \times 7
$$

---

### Step 2: Compute the Product

Now compute the value of the expression:

- $2^3 = 8$
- $3^3 = 27$
- $5^2 = 25$
- $7 = 7$

Now multiply all together:

$$
8 \times 27 = 216
$$
$$
216 \times 25 = 5400
$$
$$
5400 \times 7 = 37800

---

### Step 1: Multiply 32 and 41

We can use the distributive property:

$$
32 \times 41 = (30 + 2) \times (40 + 1) = 30 \times 40 + 30 \times 1 + 2 \times 40 + 2 \times 1
$$

$$
= 1200 + 30 + 80 + 2 = 1312
$$

So, $ 32 \times 41 = 1312 $.

---

### Step 2: Multiply the result by 13

$$
1312 \times 13 = 1312 \times (10 + 3) = 1312 \times 10 + 1312 \times 3
$$

$$
= 13120 + 3936 = 17056
$$

---

### Step 3: Verify by rearranging the multiplication

Try multiplying $ 41 \times 13 $ first:

$$
41 \times 13 = (40 + 1) \times 13 = 40 \times 13 + 1 \times 13 = 520 + 13 = 533
$$

Then multiply by 32:

$$
533 \times 32 = 533 \times (30 + 2) = 533 \times 30 + 533 \times 2
$$

$$
= 15990 + 1066 = 17056
$$

---

### Step 4: Final verification

Try multiplying $ 32 \times 13 $ first:

$$
32 \times 13 = (30 + 2) \times 13 = 30 \times 13 + 2 \times 13 = 390 + 26 = 416
$$

Then multiply by 41:

$$
416 \times 41 = 416 \times (40 + 1) = 416 \times 40 + 416 \times 1
$$

$$
= 16640 + 416 = 17056
$$

### Step 1: Multiply 32 and 41

We can use the distributive property:

$$
32 \times 41 = (30 + 2) \times (40 + 1) = 30 \times 40 + 30 \times 1 + 2 \times 40 + 2 \times 1
$$

$$
= 1200 + 30 + 80 + 2 = 1312
$$

So, $ 32 \times 41 = 1312 $.

---

### Step 2: Multiply the result by 13

$$
1312 \times 13 = 1312 \times (10 + 3) = 1312 \times 10 + 1312 \times 3
$$

$$
= 13120 + 3936 = 17056
$$

---

### Step 3: Verify by rearranging the multiplication

Try multiplying $ 41 \times 13 $ first:

$$
41 \times 13 = (40 + 1) \times 13 = 40 \times 13 + 1 \times 13 = 520 + 13 = 533
$$

Then multiply by 32:

$$
533 \times 32 = 533 \times (30 + 2) = 533 \times 30 + 533 \times 2
$$

$$
= 15990 + 1066 = 17056
$$

---

### Step 4: Final verification

Try multiplying $ 32 \times 13 $ first:

$$
32 \times 13 = (30 + 2) \times 13 = 30 \times 13 + 2 \times 13 = 390 + 26 = 416
$$

Then multiply by 41:

$$
416 \times 41 = 416 \times (40 + 1) = 416 \times 40 + 416 \times 1
$$

$$
= 16640 + 416 = 17056

$$
41 \times 13 = (40 + 1) \times 13 = 40 \times 13 + 1 \times 13 = 520 + 13 = 533
$$

Then multiply by 32:

$$
533 \times 32 = 533 \times (30 + 2) = 533 \times 30 + 533 \times 2
$$

$$
= 15990 + 1066 = 17056
$$

64000/5/4/8/2/5 #1: To compute the expression:

$$
64000 \div 5 \div 4 \div 8 \div 2 \div 5
$$

we can simplify it by recognizing that division is associative and can be rewritten as a single division:

$$
\frac{64000}{5 \times 4 \times 8 \times 2 \times 5}
$$

---

### Step 1: Multiply all the divisors

$$
5 \times 4 = 20 \\
20 \times 8 = 160 \\
160 \times 2 = 320 \\
320 \times 5 = 1600
$$

So the denominator is:

$$
5 \times 4 \times 8 \times 2 \times 5 = 1600
$$

---

### Step 2: Divide 64000 by 1600

$$
\frac{64000}{1600} = 40
$$

$$
64000 \div 5 \div 4 \div 8 \div 2 \div 5
$$

we can simplify it by recognizing that division is associative and can be rewritten as a single division:

$$
\frac{64000}{5 \times 4 \times 8 \times 2 \times 5}
$$

---

### Step 1: Multiply all the divisors

$$
5 \times 4 = 20 \\
20 \times 8 = 160 \\
160 \times 2 = 320 \\
320 \times 5 = 1600
$$

So the denominator is:

$$
5 \times 4 \times 8 \times 2 \times 5 = 1600
$$

---

### Step 2: Divide 64000 by 1600

$$
\frac{64000}{1600} = 40
$$

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{40}

250-58-17-26-39 #1: To solve the expression $ 250 - 58 - 17 - 26 - 39 $, we can approach it step by step or simplify by summing the subtrahends first.

---

### Step-by-Step Subtraction:

1. $ 250 - 58 = 192 $
2. $ 192 - 17 = 175 $
3. $ 175 - 26 = 149 $
4. $ 149 - 39 = 110 $

---

### Alternative Method: Combine Subtrahends

Add the numbers being subtracted:

- $ 58 + 17 = 75 $
- $ 26 + 39 = 65 $
- $ 75 + 65 = 140 $

Now subtract the total from 250:

- $ 250 - 140 = 110 $

---

Both methods yield the same result.

$$
101 \times 37 \times 12 \times 5 \times 8 \times 3
$$

we can simplify the multiplication by grouping terms strategically to make the calculation more manageable.

---

### Step 1: Group and simplify

Group the numbers to form easier multiplications:

- $12 \times 5 = 60$
- $8 \times 3 = 24$

Now the expression becomes:

$$
101 \times 37 \times 60 \times 24
$$

Next, compute $60 \times 24$:

$$
60 \times 24 = 1440
$$

Now the expression is:

$$
101 \times 37 \times 1440
$$

---

### Step 2: Compute $101 \times 37$

Use the identity:

$$
101 \times 37 = 37 \times (100 + 1) = 37 \times 100 + 37 = 3700 + 37 = 3737
$$

---

### Step 3: Multiply $3737 \times 1440$

Break this into parts:

- $3737 \times 1000 = 3,737,000$
- $3737 \times 400 = 1,494,800$
- $3737 \times 40 = 149,480$

Now add them:

$$
3,737,000 + 1,494,800 = 5,231,800
$$
$$
5,231,800 + 149,480 = 5,381,280
$$

Group the numbers to form easier multiplications:

- $12 \times 5 = 60$
- $8 \times 3 = 24$

Now the expression becomes:

$$
101 \times 37 \times 60 \times 24
$$

Next, compute $60 \times 24$:

$$
60 \times 24 = 1440
$$

Now the expression is:

$$
101 \times 37 \times 1440
$$

---

### Step 2: Compute $101 \times 37$

Use the identity:

$$
101 \times 37 = 37 \times (100 + 1) = 37 \times 100 + 37 = 3700 + 37 = 3737
$$

---

### Step 3: Multiply $3737 \times 1440$

Break this into parts:

- $3737 \times 1000 = 3,737,000$
- $3737 \times 400 = 1,494,800$
- $3737 \times 40 = 149,480$

Now add them:

$$
3,737,000 + 1,494,800 = 5,231,800
$$
$$
5,231,800 + 149,480 = 5,381,280
$$

---

### Final Answer

### Step 1: Group and simplify

Group the numbers to form easier multiplications:

- $12 \times 5 = 60$
- $8 \times 3 = 24$

Now the expression becomes:

$$
101 \times 37 \times 60 \times 24

### Step 2: Compute $101 \times 37$

Use the identity:

$$
101 \times 37 = 37 \times (100 + 1) = 37 \times 100 + 37 = 3700 + 37 = 3737

### Step-by-step Addition:

1. **Add 58 and 17**  
   $$
   58 + 17 = 75
   $$

2. **Add 26 to the result**  
   $$
   75 + 26 = 101
   $$

3. **Add 39 to the result**  
   $$

   $$

4. **Add 14 to the result**  
   $$

$$
104 + 305 + 694 + 88 + 17 + 56
$$

we can simplify the process by grouping numbers that add up to round or easier-to-calculate values.

---

### Step 1: Group numbers for easier addition

- **104 + 694 = 798**  
  (Because $100 + 694 = 794$, and adding 4 gives 798)

- **88 + 56 = 144**  
  (Because $80 + 50 = 130$, and $8 + 6 = 14$, so $130 + 14 = 144$)

- **305 + 17 = 322**  
  (Because $305 + 10 = 315$, and $315 + 7 = 322$)

---

### Step 2: Add the results of the grouped sums

Now we add:

$$
798 + 144 + 322
$$

- First, $798 + 144 = 942$
- Then, $942 + 322 = 1264$

$$
638 + 837 + 921 + 145 + 302 + 49
$$

we proceed step by step, ensuring accuracy through both direct addition and cross-checking with digit-wise addition.

---

### Step-by-step Addition:

1. **Add 638 and 837:**
   $$
   638 + 837 = 1475
   $$

2. **Add 921 to the result:**
   $$
   1475 + 921 = 2396
   $$

3. **Add 145 to the result:**
   $$
   2396 + 145 = 2541
   $$

4. **Add 302 to the result:**
   $$
   2541 + 302 = 2843
   $$

5. **Add 49 to the result:**
   $$
   2843 + 49 = 2892
   $$

---

### Cross-Check via Digit-wise Addition:

- **Units place:**  
  $8 + 7 + 1 + 5 + 2 + 9 = 32$ → write **2**, carry **3**

- **Tens place:**  
  $3 + 3 + 2 + 4 + 0 + 4 = 16$, plus carry **3** → $19$ → write **9**, carry **1**

- **Hundreds place:**  
  $6 + 8 + 9 + 1 + 3 + 0 = 27$, plus carry **1** → $28$ → write **8**, carry **2**

- **Thousands place:**  
  Carry **2** → write **2**

So the final result is:

---

### Step 1: Group numbers for easier addition

- **104 + 694 = 798**  
  (Because $100 + 694 = 794$, and adding 4 gives 798)

- **88 + 56 = 144**

### Step 1: Multiply $ 32 \times 41 $

We break this down as:
$$
32 \times 41 = 32 \times (40 + 1) = (32 \times 40) + (32 \times 1)
$$
$$

### Step 2: Multiply the result by 13

Now multiply $ 1312 \times 13 $:
$$
1312 \times 13 = 1312 \times (10 + 3) = (1312 \times 10) + (1312 \times 3)

---

### Step 1: Evaluate Brackets
We start with the expression inside the parentheses:
$$
5 + 5 = 10
$$
So the expression becomes:
$$
50 / 10 \times 6 - 4
$$

---

### Step 2: Perform Division and Multiplication from Left to Right
Now, we handle division and multiplication in order from left to right.

- First, divide:
$$
50 / 10 = 5
$$

- Then multiply:
$$
5 \times 6 = 30
$$

So now the expression is:
$$
30 - 4
$$

---

### Step 3: Perform Subtraction
Finally, subtract:
$$
30 - 4 = 26
$$
